# React19 Test

## Description

Here are some testable features of React 19 and Next 15.

## Features

### hook-form

- tested whether the `react-hook-form` library works properly without any components with forwarded refs.
- tested whether the features of react 19 (e.g `useActionState`) can be an useful alternative to the `react-hook-form` library.

### internationalization

- implemented the internationalization feature using Next.js's built-in support for i18n.
